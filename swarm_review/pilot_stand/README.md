# Pilot Stand

This folder is a persistent test bench for flow evolution runs.

## Purpose

- Use real projects as pilot environments.
- Compare expectations vs actual run results.
- Record gaps, failures, and ignored requirements.
- Track satisfaction and confidence by flow version.
- Mark versions as `Stable` only when satisfaction >=95%.

## Current Pilot Project

- `006_epub`: `swarm_review/pilot_stand/006_epub/`
